    <p>GuessTheMovie is a small project I created as a personal endeavor to practice using some new tools, inspired by popular games like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle</a>, <a href="https://guessthe.game/" target="_blank">GuessTheGame</a>, <a href="https://framed.wtf/" target="_blank">Framed</a>, and my own love of movies.</p>

    <p>The main objective of this project was to explore and test out various technologies, including <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">Postgrest</a>, PWA (Progressive Web App) development with Vue, and deploying the game to the Google Play Store.</p>

    <p>Most of the images have been sourced from <a href="https://film-grab.com/" target="_blank">Film-Grab</a>, while others were created by me.</p>

    <p>Note: GuessTheMovie is an independent project and not affiliated with Film-grab or any movie studios. All rights belong to their respective owners.</p>
